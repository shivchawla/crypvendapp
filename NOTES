IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS WHEN RUNNING APP

1. Metro.config,js has to be modified to prevent duplicated as web directoy includes node_modules and it was leading to duplicates to node_modules

2. Add browser specific buffer module to make it work in react-native ``require('buffer/').Buffer``;

3. react-native-ssl-pinning related error; 
Canceled due to java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method log(ILjava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V in class Lokhttp3/internal/platform/Platform;
Fix: https://github.com/MaxToyberman/react-native-ssl-pinning/issues/132

4. Is SSL pinning even used, looking at the current code, disableAllSecurityFlag is true which means NO ssl/public key pinning is active; WHY is it in use yet;

5. When using in dev mode, lamassu-server needs to be started with --dev flag to prevent http request in https environment

6. There is no browser in case of react-native app, so lamassu-machine browser Events is replace by browserEmit (which is just a mechanism to emit events to other parts of app)

7. In OKHTTPS from react-native pinning, output has "status" and not "statusCode", Use npx patch-package to modify the output to "statusCode"

6. bignumber.js is still very old version v4.0.1; Keep using it;
